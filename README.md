# Hello, I am Aniha 👋

Aspiring QA engineer with a passion for writing test automation scripts—almost as much as I enjoy gym sessions, cats, and long walks 🐾💪

With background in tech support and claims, I have now shifted my focus to quality assurance and test automation using Selenium, Pytest, Playwright, and Robot Framework. Currently sharpening my skills and actively seeking QA opportunities.

## What my repos show
- ✅ Login validation with Data Driven Testing  
- 🧲 Drag and drop UI testing  
- 🌐 Headless browser automation  
- ⚙️ Handling AJAX and dynamic web content  
- 🧪 Playwright test automation projects  
- 📈 Excel-based Selenium framework for OrangeHRM

## Currently learning
- ☁️ Jenkins CI/CD for continuous testing  
- 🌐 API testing fundamentals  
- 🧵 Behavior-Driven Development with Behave

## Fun Fact
I believe test automation is a bit like the gym—both need patience, consistency, and sometimes a little sweat to get results!

Based in Ontario, Canada. Open to connect for QA discussions or collaborations.
